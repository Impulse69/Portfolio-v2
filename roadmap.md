# Project Roadmap: Transforming into a Portfolio Application

This document outlines the steps to convert the current project into a personal portfolio application.

## 1. Project Analysis and Setup

*   **Review Existing Structure:** Understand the current `src` directory, `components`, `pages`, and `assets` to identify reusable elements and areas needing significant changes.
*   **Dependency Check:** Ensure all current dependencies are relevant or identify new ones needed for portfolio features (e.g., animations, form handling if contact form is dynamic).
*   **Clean Up:** Remove any pages or components not relevant to a portfolio (e.g., `SignIn`, `SignUp`, `ResetPassword` pages).

## 2. Defining Portfolio Sections

Conceptualize and outline the main sections typical for a portfolio:

*   **Home/Landing Page:** Introduction, brief overview of skills/expertise.
*   **About Me:** Detailed biography, skills, experience, education.
*   **Projects:** Showcase of past work with descriptions, links to live demos/repositories, and relevant technologies.
*   **Contact:** Form or direct contact information (email, social media links).
*   **Resume/CV:** Link to a downloadable PDF of the resume.

## 3. Component Development

Create new React components for each portfolio section:

*   **`components/Hero.jsx`**: For the landing page introductory section.
*   **`components/AboutSection.jsx`**: For the "About Me" content.
*   **`components/ProjectsGrid.jsx`**: To display multiple project cards.
*   **`components/ProjectCard.jsx`**: Individual component for each project.
*   **`components/ContactForm.jsx`**: For the contact section.
*   **`components/Header.jsx`**: Global navigation bar.
*   **`components/Footer.jsx`**: Global footer.

## 4. Routing Updates (`src/App.jsx`)

Modify `App.jsx` to define routes for the new portfolio sections:

*   `/`: Home Page
*   `/about`: About Me Page
*   `/projects`: Projects Page
*   `/contact`: Contact Page
*   (Optional) `/resume`: A route for the resume/CV if hosted directly.

## 5. Design and Styling

*   **Tailwind CSS Customization:** Adjust `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` to define custom colors, fonts, and spacing suitable for a personal brand.
*   **CSS Refinement:** Update `src/css/style.css` and other relevant CSS files to apply new styles for portfolio elements, ensuring responsiveness.
*   **AOS Integration:** Continue using AOS for scroll animations to enhance user experience on project reveals or section transitions.

## 6. Content Integration

*   **Placeholder Content:** Populate new components with placeholder text and images.
*   **Dynamic Data:** Consider using a JSON file or external API for projects data to make it easily manageable and scalable.
*   **Media Assets:** Organize images, videos, and other media in the `public` or `src/assets` directory.

## 7. Navigation and User Experience

*   **Navbar Implementation:** Create a responsive navigation bar using the `Header` component to link to all main portfolio sections.
*   **Smooth Scrolling:** Ensure smooth navigation within the single-page application experience.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement a 404 page for invalid routes.

## 8. Deployment Considerations

*   **Build Process:** Use `npm run build` to create a production-ready build.
*   **Hosting:** Suggest platforms like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or Render for deployment.
*   **Domain:** Advise on custom domain setup.

## Next Steps

1.  Create the `roadmap.md` file.
2.  Start by cleaning up unnecessary existing files.
3.  Begin developing the `Header` and `Footer` components to establish the overall layout.
4.  Then proceed with the main sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contact.
